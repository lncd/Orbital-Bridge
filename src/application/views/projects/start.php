			<h4>New Funded Projects</h4>
				<p>If you're starting a new funded project, you should use the University's <a href="http://ams.lincoln.ac.uk">Award's Management System</a>. Once your project is created using the AMS it will appear in your Research Dashboard automatically.</p>
			
		</div>
		
		<p>Adding a research project to your Research Dashboard is the easiest way to create a complete research environment for your project, including making the University's Research and Enterprise office aware of what you're working on, adding the project to your Staff Profile, preparing groups and permissions in the CKAN research data repository and more.</p>
		
		<p>You should add any current unfunded projects and all your historical research projects at the University of Lincoln to your Researcher Dashboard to help build the most accurate picture of your research.</p>
